  Shade-grown coffee

  Coffee is a small tree or shrub that grows in the forest understory in its
  wild form, and traditionally was grown commercially under other trees that
  provided shade. The forest-like structure of shade coffee farms provides
  habitat for a great number of migratory and resident species.


  Single origin

  Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic origin.
  Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans from a
  single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it was grown
  to whatever degree available.


  Sustainable farming

  Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an
  understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between
  organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are a
  matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.


  Direct sourcing

  Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters.
  Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price
  negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and
  incentivize quality.
